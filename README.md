# Pollux Cipher

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the Pollux Cipher. It is a cipher that first converts the plaintext into Morse code which is written as a series of dots, dashes and spaces. The ciphertext is then generated by mapping the dots, dashes and spaces to numbers to the encoder's choice. To decrypt the ciphertext, the numbers are mapped back to dots, dashes and spaces and then converted back to plaintext.

## Usage

### Encryption

To encrypt a plaintext, run the following command:

```bash
pollux encode <plaintext>
```

### Decryption

To decrypt a ciphertext, run the following command:

```bash
pollux decode <ciphertext>
```

## Installation

### From Source

To install from source, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone 
cd pollux
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

If you want to install the program to your system on MacOS or Linux, run the following command:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```

If you want to install the program to your system on Windows, run the following command in an administrator command prompt:

```bash
cmake --install build
```
